My Mac Air 2013 still alive, but its performance are worst. On internet they say I can disable `mds` to make Mac Air (2013) **FAST** again

note: `mds` are tools for osx to indexing file. If we disable, it will effect speed on searching file, but we can run manual indexing.

**to disable**

```sh
sudo mdutil -a -i off
```

**to check status**

```sh
mdutil -a -s -v
```

**to re-index** (must be overnight jobs)

```sh
sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*
```
