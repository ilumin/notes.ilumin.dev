## Have a vision (maybe even the right one)

- make our infrastructure cheaper to run!
- Make it easier to debug problems!
- Improve reliability by making it harder for humans to make mistakes!
- protect our customers from fraud
- to do a thing, we need a framework to make it clear
- How to have a vision if I wasn’t even sure what the Right Vision Was!
  He suggested just picking a vision that seemed mostly reasonable and then moving that way until I learned more.

## Focus (do one thing at a time, maybe two)

- When I actually focus on a thing, I’m always amazed by how much I can get done.
- If I do more than about 2 things, then all of the things take forever to get finished.

## Learn how to break things down

- I think this is how you get from 'vision' to 'focus' -- you can’t actually execute on all the parts of your vision at the same time.

## Try to get something done every day

- if I’m doing an Important Thing ("do one thing at a time, maybe two!"),
  then I should try to make at least some progress on the Important Thing every day.
  If I do that, then I’m definitely always getting stuff done.

## Talk to someone when I get stuck

- top feeling bad about telling someone when I’m stuck, and just go talk through whatever I’m working on with a person who usually helps me get unstuck

## Don’t be scared of small problems

## Do whatever’s necessary

## Have deadlines

- deadlines are helpful to see when something’s growing in scope uncontrollably
  or is taking a lot longer than you thought. Then maybe I can cut features!

## Be organized enough

## Believe in yourself
