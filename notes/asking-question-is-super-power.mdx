- There are all kinds of things that I think I "should" know and don't.
- started trying to ask questions any time I don't understand something,
  instead of worrying about whether people will think I'm dumb for not knowing it.
  This is magical, because it means I can then learn those things!
- be skeptical! Don't believe what people say even if they're using fancy words!

## "I don't understand."

- if someone is explaining something to me and it doesn't make sense, it's possible that they're explaining it badly!
  Or that I'm tired! Or any other number of reasons. But if I don't tell them I'm don't understand,
  I'm never going to understand the damn thing.

## Avoiding mansplaining

- I have to be pretty careful about asking the right questions and making it clear
  which parts I know already. This is just good hygiene, and makes sure nobody's time gets wasted.
- For instance, I have sometimes said things like "I don't know anything about statistics",
  which is actually false and sometimes results in people trying to explain basic
  probability theory to me, or what an estimator is, or maybe the difference between
  a biased and unbiased estimator. It turns out these are actually things I know!
  So I need to be more specific, like "can we walk through some basic survival analysis?"
  (actually a thing I would like to understand!)

## HUGE SUCCESS

- Understanding and learning are more important than feeling smart.
