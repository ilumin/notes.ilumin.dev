In TypeScript we might need to import type and use it to build our type

for example

```jsx
import React, { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
```

But we can use `import type` so that build tools will remove `import type` line without ruining the output of code

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import type { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
```

I guess it will effect build performance too, just guess ðŸ¤”
